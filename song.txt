Some times some crimes
Go slippin' through the cracks
But these two gumshoes
Are pickin' up the slack
 
There's no case too big, no case too small
When you need help just call

Ch-ch-ch-Chip 'n Dale
Rescue Rangers
Ch-ch-ch-Chip 'n Dale
When there's danger
Oh no, it never fails
Once they're involved
Somehow whatever's wrong gets solved
